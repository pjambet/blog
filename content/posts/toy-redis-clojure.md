_This is the second entry in the "Building Toy Redises in X" series". In [the first article](/posts/toy-redis-go/) we used Go, in this one we'll use Clojure._

_One of the approaches explored in this article is very similar to the one used in Go, with the use of Channels, so reading it first might help._

## What we're building

TODO: Write me

## Starting small, a TCP server and nothing else

One of the great things with Clojure is that you get access to everything that Java offers. So when it comes to starting a TCP server, we can use Java's [`ServerSocket` class][java-server-socket], instantiate it with the port number it should listen to, and use its [`accept` method][java-server-socket-accept] to accept new clients.

We get back a `Socket` instance, which we can conveniently use [`clojure.java.io/writer`][clj-java-writer] with, to get back an instance of `java.io.BufferedWriter`. With that writer instance, we can now write to the socket with the `write` method, and we need to call `flush`, to make sure the data gets written, and can be read on the other end.

Finally, we close the socket with `close`, because we'll deal with concurrency later in this post.

```clj
(ns tcp
  (:require [clojure.java.io :as io])
  (:import (java.net ServerSocket)))

(defn handle-client
  [client]
  (let [writer (io/writer client)]
    (.write writer "Hello ðŸ‘‹\n")
    (.flush writer)
    (.close client)))


(defn main
  []
  (with-open [server-socket (ServerSocket. 3000)]
     (loop []
       (let [client-socket (.accept server-socket)]
         (handle-client client-socket))
       (recur))))

(main)
```

You can run the program with `clj -M tcp.clj` and connect to it with `nc -v localhost 3000`.

## Keeping the connections open

Let's now make the server keep the connections open, wait for the clients to send _something_ over the wire, and respond back. We will use Clojure's `core/async` library to help with concurrency, for the main reason that I couldn't think of any other solutions.

`core/async` [shares a lot with Go's concurrency mechanisms][clj-and-go-sitting-in-a-tree] with couroutines, so if you read the previous entry in this series, this should all look pretty familiar.

{{% note %}}

If you're thinking "well, since we can use anything that exists in Java, we could use Java's non blocking IO library, java.nio, it's been available since Java 7". Well, you're probably right, I'm sure we _could_, but I will actually dedicate a whole article to that topic, about building a Toy Redis, in Java, using the nio package!

{{% /note %}}

Clojure lets us spin up new threads, which we could use to handle concurrent clients, but instead we'll use a higher level abstraction, Go Blocks. If you've read the previous post, or are familiar with Go, this is very similar to coroutines created with the `go` keyword.

`core.async` provides the `go` macro, it asynchronously executes the body we give it. The following example starts a go block, prints immediately the first statement from the block, and then the one from the main thread, then sleeps for 5s and finally prints done:

```clj
(def sleep-time 5000)
(a/go
  (println (str "sleeping for " sleep-time "ms"))
  (Thread/sleep sleep-time)
  (println "done!"))
(println "Printing from main thread")
```

You can run start from the REPL with `clj -Sdeps '{:deps {org.clojure/core.async {:mvn/version "1.5.648"}}}` and then with:

```
Clojure 1.11.1
user=> (require '[clojure.core.async :as a])
nil
user=> (def sleep-time 5000)
#'user/sleep-time
user=> (a/go
  (println (str "sleeping for " sleep-time "ms"))
  (Thread/sleep sleep-time)
  (println "done!"))
(println "Printing from main thread")
#object[clojure.core.async.impl.channels.ManyToManyChannel 0x2b3ac26d "clojure.core.async.impl.channels.ManyToManyChannel@2b3ac26d"]
sleeping for 5000ms
user=> Printing from main thread
nil
user=> done!
```

We can now start a new go block for each new client, but first, let's require it:

```clj
(ns concurrent-server
  (:require [clojure.java.io :as io]
            [clojure.core.async :as a])
  (:import (java.net ServerSocket)))
;; ...
```

And we can now us `a/go`:

```clj
(defn handle-client
  [client]
  (a/go
    (loop []
      ;; ...
      )))
```

Now that each client is given its own go block, we can start reading from clients:

```clj
(loop []
  (let [request (.readLine (io/reader client))
        writer (io/writer client)]
    (do
      (.write writer "Hello ðŸ‘‹\n")
      (.flush writer)
      (recur))))
```

With `io/reader`, we get back an instance of `java.io.BufferedReader`, on which we can call the `.readLine` method, and get a `String` back. This change means that we now only write back to the client after we received something. In other words, the connection will stay open, and unused, until the client sends a line of text. After which it writes `"Hello ðŸ‘‹\n"` and waits for the next line of text.

There is an issue however, if the client disconnects before the server is stopped, an exception will be thrown, and uncaught, in the thread started by the go block. You can see this behavior by starting the server with: `clj -Sdeps '{:deps {org.clojure/core.async {:mvn/version "1.5.648"}}}' -M content/src/clj-tcp-server/concurrent_server.clj`, connecting to it with `nc localhost 3000` from another terminal, and then closing the client with `Ctrl-C`. The following exception will show up in the server logs:

```
Exception in thread "async-dispatch-1" java.net.SocketException: Broken pipe
```

I didn't include the full stacktrace, but if you were to look at it, despite it being kinda cryptic, we can see that the error occurs when we attempt to write to the socket. We can prevent this by checking if the result of `.readLine` is `nil`, in which case, we can close the connection on the server's end, since the client is gone.

The following is the full version of `handle-client`:

```clj
(defn handle-client
  [client]
  (a/go
    (loop []
      (let [request (.readLine (io/reader client))
            writer (io/writer client)]
        (if (nil? request)
          (do
            (println "Nil response, closing client")
            (.close client))
          (do
            (.write writer "Hello ðŸ‘‹\n")
            (.flush writer)
            (recur)))))))
```

## Making the server stateful

The last step is to turn this whole thing stateful. We want the server to store data, so that other clients can read from it.

Clojure's collections are immutable, so we don't have that many options for our go blocks to share the same data structure to read and write on. In the previous chapter we initially tried an approach where we created a map in the main function and passed it to each coroutine, something like this:

```clj
(defn main
  []
  (with-open [server-socket (ServerSocket. 3000)]
    (loop []
      (let [client-socket (.accept server-socket)
            db (hash-map)]
        (handle-client client-socket db)
        (recur)))))
```

But then `handle-client` can't modify `db` in a way that would be seen by other go blocks. We can for instance add new entries to it:

```clj
(defn handle-client
  [client original-db]
  (a/go
    (loop [db original-db]
      (let [request (.readLine (io/reader client))
            writer (io/writer client)]
        (if (nil? request)
          (do
            (println "Nil response, closing client")
            (.close client))
          (let [updated-db (assoc db (.hashCode client) (System/currentTimeMillis))]
            (.write writer "Hello ðŸ‘‹\n")
            (.flush writer)
            (recur updated-db)))))))
```

In this example we store the timestamp of the most recent line we received from the client, where the key is the `.hashCode` value of the client. Yes, this is a very contrived example, the only purpose is to show that we have no easy way to make the updates made to the map visible to the outside. The `handle-client` function returns a channel, which we ignore, because we don't need it. Because we execute a go block, we cannot return data to the caller.

We will explore two approaches to address this issue:

- One very similar to the Go chapter, Channels!
- [Atoms](https://clojure.org/reference/atoms), clojure's builtin "[...] way to manage shared, synchronous, independent state"

### Channels

Let's start with the channel version, and we'll look at atoms next.

We'll create one channel in the main function, for all the go blocks to send the requests received from clients to a go block that will handle storing the data and send it back over a different channel, so that a response can be written back to the client. Let's see what it looks like, first the main function:

```clj
(defn main
  []
  (let [command-channel (a/chan)]
    (with-open [server-socket (ServerSocket. 3000)]
      (handle-db command-channel)
      (loop []
        (let [client-socket (.accept server-socket)]
          (handle-client client-socket command-channel)
          (recur))))))
```

You may have noticed that on top of passing `command-channel` to each call of `handle-client`, we also pass it to `handle-db`, before starting the loop. Let's take a look at that function:

```clj
(defn handle-db
  [command-channel]
  (a/go
    (loop [db (hash-map)]
      (let [resp (a/<! command-channel)
            timestamp (System/currentTimeMillis)
            updated-db (assoc db (.hashCode (:client resp)) timestamp)]
        (a/>! (:channel resp) timestamp)
        (recur updated-db)))))
```

The function runs entirely in a go block, and starts an infinite loop with a `hash-map`. The first thing it does is wait for a message to be sent to the channel it was given as an argument. When it receives a message, it stores the current timestamp associated with the client that sent the message. It effectively stores the timestamp of the last time it processed a message sent by a client.

Then, it extracts the `:channel` field from the message, and write the timestamp back to it. Finally, it calls `recur` with the updated `hash-map`, so that the next iteration sees the changes made to it.

Now, let's look at `handle-client`, how it sends messages to `command-channel`, and how it reads back what `handle-db` sends back after receiving the message:

```clj
(defn handle-client
  [client channel]
  (a/go
    (loop []
      (let [request (.readLine (io/reader client))
            writer (io/writer client)
            message {:channel (a/chan) :client client}] ;; (1)
        (if (nil? request)
          (do (println "Nil response, closing client")
              (.close client))
          (do (a/>! channel message) ;; (2)
              (let [result (a/<! (:channel message))] ;; (3)
                (.write writer (str "OK, " result "\n"))
                (.flush writer)
                (recur))))))))
```

Let's look at the three main changes:

- In `(1)`, we create a `hash-map`, called `message`, with two keys, `:channel` is a newly built channel, so that `handle-db` can send back a message to us.
- In `(2)`, when we have a non-nil message, we send `message` to the the channel created in the `main` function.
- In `(3)`, we wait to get a response back from the `:channel` field of the message `hash-map`, and store the result in the `result` variable. We then write back the content to the client, sending them the timestamp stored in the internal db.

This is another contrived example, storing the last timestamp of when we received _something_ from a client is not that useful. But we can use this archiecture to build our Toy Redis!


## Putting everything together.

We want to support the following commands:

- 1
- 2
- 3
- ...


## Atoms

TODO: Write me ...

To work with atoms, you first create one, with the `atom` function:

```clj
(def database (atom (hash-map)))
```

You can then dereference it to get its content:

```clj
@database ;; {}
```

And update them with `swap!`, to which you pass the atom and a function to update its state:

```clj
(swap! database
       (fn [current-state]
         (assoc current-state "abc" "123")))
;; {"abc" "123"}
```

And we can confirm that the state was updated:

```clj
@database ;; {"abc" "123"}
```
